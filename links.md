## Final Submission - Links

You must include **three links** in this file.

---

### 1. Installable Android Build (EAS Build)

**Steps to generate:**
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```
2. When the build finishes, you’ll receive a link like:
   ```
   https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/...
   ```
3. Add the link to the table of links.

> This confirms that you can package and ship your app successfully.

---

### 2. Backend URL

Your **Node.js + Express + MongoDB API** must be **deployed** (e.g., on [Render](https://render.com/) or [Railway](https://railway.app/)).

Include your **live base URL**, for example:
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/
```
in the table of links.  

> This verifies that your backend is live, persistent, and serving real data.

### 3. Demo Video (3–5 Minutes)

Record your app running on a **real phone** and upload it to **Google Drive**.

#### Your video must show:
- Navigation across multiple screens  
- At least one device feature (camera, location, etc.)  
- Interaction with your backend (creating a todo, saving a note, posting a location log)

#### After recording:
1. Upload the video to Google Drive.  
2. Set the sharing permissions to:  
   - **Anyone with the link → Viewer**
3. Copy the shareable link and paste it in the table of links.

> ⚠️ Do **not** include personal or sensitive information in your demo.  
> The video may be viewed by course staff or shared for feedback.
